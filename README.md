# Basic Math Worksheet Generator

This is a basic math practice worksheet generator for educational use.

This is a single file, to be run in a web browser supporting Javascript, that generates math practice worksheets for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I started working on this when one of my children's teachers expressed interest in such a tool. I would like this basic math worksheet generator to be available for anyone to practice math skills.

This generator was originally published on [Codeplex](https://mathworksheet.codeplex.com/) before that site shut down.

## Usage

The general procedure is to make any desired adjustments, and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button.

The configuration and the actions will not print; however, browser settings (like page numbers and file location) may print depending on your browser's configuration.

1. To use this worksheet generator, open it in a web browser that supports [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
1. Modify any of the values in the configuration block at the top, or accept the defaults.
1. Click on the "Generate Worksheet" button to see what random numbers you get for this worksheet! At this time, you may wish to print the worksheet, either to a printer or print to file.
1. If desired, click the checkbox for "Show Answers" and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button again. You will now have an answer key for the worksheet you made in the previous step! At this time, you may wish to print the answer key, either to a printer or print to file.
1. After creating your first worksheet and its answer key, if desired, you can click on the "Same values in a different order" button to mix up the numbers. This function allows you to give a group of learners similar -but not identical- quizzes. Next click on the "Generate Worksheet" button to get the new quiz. Print as desired.
1. If you'd like a completely new worksheet, you may optionally adjust the configuration if desired. However, to get a new set of random numbers, you will also need to click on the "New set of random numbers" button and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button. Print as desired.
