# Basic Math Worksheet Generator

BasicMath.html is a generator of basic math practice worksheets for educational use.

BasicMath.html is a single file, to be run in a web browser supporting Javascript, that generates math practice worksheets for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I started working on this when one of my children's teachers expressed interest in such a tool. I would like this basic math worksheet generator to be available for anyone to practice math skills.

I originally published this generator on [Codeplex](https://mathworksheet.codeplex.com/) before that site shut down; [jmrker](http://www.codingforums.com/javascript-programming/184125-creating-math-sheet-generator.html#post897542) wrote the original generator that forms the basis of this one.

## Usage

The general procedure is to make any desired adjustments, and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button. After your broswer displays the worksheet, you may print it to a printer, or print it to a file.

The configuration and the actions will not print, just the worksheet; however, browser settings (like page numbers and file location) may print depending on your browser's configuration.

1. To use this worksheet generator, open BasicMath.html in a web browser that supports [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
1. Modify any of the values in the configuration block at the top, or accept the defaults.
1. Click on the "Generate Worksheet" button to see what random numbers you get for this worksheet! At this time, you may wish to print the worksheet.
1. If desired, click the checkbox for "Show Answers" and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button again. You will now have an answer key for the worksheet you made in the previous step! At this time, you may wish to print the answer key.
1. After creating your first worksheet and its answer key, if desired, you can click on the "Same values in a different order" button to mix up the numbers. This function yields similar -but not identical- quizzes. Next click on the "Generate Worksheet" button to get the new-yet-similar quiz. Print as desired.
1. If desired, adjust the configuration for a completely new worksheet. To get a new set of random numbers, you will also need to click on the "New set of random numbers" button and then click on the "Generate Worksheet" button. Print as desired.
